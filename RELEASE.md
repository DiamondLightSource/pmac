pmac Releases
=============

The latest untagged master branch can be obtained at
https://github.com/dls-controls/pmac.

Tagged source code releases from 2-0 onward can be obtained at
https://github.com/dls-controls/pmac/releases (earlier versions are not
recommended)

The versions of EPICS base, asyn, and motor modules used for
each release can be obtained from configure/RELEASE.local. The file
configure/RELEASE.linux-x86_64.Common should be modified to reflect
site location of dependencies.

Release Notes
=============

R2-5-16 (May 26, 2022)
==========================
### Changes
* A fix in 2-5-10 caused the .REP field to just show the following error when the encoder is on the same
  axis (versus another channel). Previous behaviour has now been restored for this type of axis:
    * .RMP is reported position plus following error
    * .REP is reported position without following error
    * This allows the following error and max following error records to work again.

R2-5-15 (May 26, 2022)
==========================
### Changes
* Soft limit behaviour has been changed in pmacController. When setting soft limits which result in
either ix13 or ix14 being zero (i.e. not both) the soft limit is now set to 1 count to avoid disabling
it. To disable soft limits you can set DHLM=DLLM=0, which is consistent with the motor record behaviour.

R2-5-14 (May 3, 2022)
==========================
### Changes
* pmacAxis: increase setting resolution and offset precision to 12 d.p. to fully fix loss of precision introduced in 2-5

==========================
### Changes

R2-5 (June 1, 2021)
===================

    * 2: Velocity = Average Prev -> Current
    * 3: Velocity = 0
    * 4: Velocity = Average Current -> Next

* Updates to support VME pmac devices
* Avoid long at startup pause waiting to list kinematics on Power Pmac
* Fix incorrect NAXES column in xeb
* New PROG1.pmc with "Average Previous to Current" velocity mode 2
  * This supports changes in Malcolm (post version 4-2b5) to avoid accumulation of errors in long sparse trajectories

R2-4-17 (Feb 6, 2020)
=====================
### Changes
* Stop manual axes CS defs clearing previously defined groups
* Improved connection logic for PMAC controllers
    * Driver can now start in disconnected state
    * Driver can connect when hardware is available
    * Driver can disconnect and reconnect
* Fixed missing colon in motor record name
* Fixed CS bug, was looping over raw axis total instead of CS total
* Improved trajectory scan error reporting
* Updated motor builder object PORT field description

R2-1 (May 23, 2018)
===================
### Changes
* restore continuous integration (new synapps dependencies)
* Fix seg fault on startup with no brick connected
* clean up compiler warnings
* Add Power Pmac IDE project as example configuration
* Get all system tests working against PPmac
    * except trajectory scan tests - not yet supported
* Fix coordinate system control features for ppmac
* Added $(PMAC):PollAllNow PV -
    * put value 1 with callback
    * synchronizes the current brick status
* fix issues with feedrate check (now compatible with PPMAC)

R2-0-1 (May 23, 2018)
=====================
### Changes
* fix example IOC to build outside of Diamond

R2-0 (May 23, 2018)
===================
### Changes
* fixes to issues with Coordinate System motors demand and read-back
inconsistency
* fixes to any issues with race conditions due to a lack of parameter
library locking
* now works with clipper
* supports 'direct demands'
    * for avoiding the pitfalls of the motor record (particularly with
    deferred moves)
* implements coordinated deferred moves:
    *  a set of motors can be commanded to start and complete motion at
    the same time.
* updated edm GUI
* simplified templates and builder support
* stop now always works
    * stop a trajectory scan or coordinate system motor by clicking
    stop on one of the real motors
* full suite of system tests using py.test

Note that I'm now making dls-master and master the SAME. To make
this friendly to external users I have:-

* I have fixed the etc/Makefile so that it skips the folder if builder
is not available
* I have commented the required configure files to say they need
changes for each site
* I have added a non-builder example IOC (with edm GUI)
